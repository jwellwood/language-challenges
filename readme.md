# Challenges

1. `npm i`to install typescript
2. `npm run build` to compile
3. `npm start`to see answers in the console

### 1. Flatten array

- Part A

An immutable function that flattens a multidimensional array.

- Part B

Add types to the function, assuming the types within the array are always the same

### 2. Deep Access

- Part A

Access values of deeply nested objects

- Part B

Set values in deeply nested objects

# 3. √Årbol

Generate a tree structure using typescript. The structure has a root node and children that branch off. The final node on a branch is the leaf

# 4. Console logs

Changes the order that messages are logged to the console, only modifying one function: run()

# 5. Memoization

- Part A

Create a function that memoizes an expensive function call to avoid subsequent calls. It can be assumed the functions being memoized don't have arguments and won't be null/undefined

- Part B

The same as part A but in only one line

- Part C

The same as above but supposing the function to memoize might have arguments. For simplicity, we can assume the arguments are of primitive types: string, number or boolean, and they are not undefined.
